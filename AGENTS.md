This project is a C-to-V translator.

Always run project commands from the repository root:
`.../.vmodules/c2v`.

# Instruction Priority
If instructions conflict, follow them in this order:
1. System/developer/user instructions from the active session.
2. This `AGENTS.md` file.

# Prerequisites
Verify required tools before build/test commands:
1. `v version`
2. `cc --version` (or `clang --version`)

If either tool is missing, stop and report the missing dependency.

# Canonical Commands
1. Build: `v .`
2. Run one C test file: `v run tests/run_tests.vsh tests/ptr_deref.c`
3. Run all tests: `v run tests/run_tests.vsh`
4. Format translator sources only: `v fmt -w src/`

# Machine-Checkable Success Signals
- Build succeeds when `v .` exits with code `0`.
- Single-test succeeds when command exits with `0` and output contains no `FAIL`.
- Full test run succeeds when command exits with `0` and output contains no `FAIL`.
- Formatting succeeds when `v fmt -w src/` exits with code `0`.

# Runtime Guidance
- Build and single-test are the default validation loop.
- Full test run is slower; run it before finishing substantial code changes.
- The test runner rebuilds `c2v` and formats generated `tests/*.v` files during execution.

# Do Not
- Do not run project commands from subdirectories.
- Do not run single-test mode with non-`tests/*.c` paths.
- Do not format outside `src/` unless explicitly requested.

# Troubleshooting
- Wrong folder: run `pwd` and ensure it ends with `.vmodules/c2v`.
- `v` not found: verify with `v version`.
- C compiler not found: verify with `cc --version` or `clang --version`.
- Single-test path issues: pass a `.c` file under `tests/`, for example `tests/ptr_deref.c`.
- If output is noisy, check command exit code first; non-zero exit means failure.

# Pre-PR Checklist
Run the Canonical Commands in order:
1. Build.
2. Single test (`tests/ptr_deref.c`).
3. Full test suite.
4. Format `src/`.
